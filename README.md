## How to compile the project

### Locally

> For compiling the project locally, a TeX distribution like [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) or [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) must be installed. 
> Run:
> ```shell
> latexmk -pv
> ```

### Let Github do the work

> - The latest version of the main branch is always available at https://axherrrm.github.io/bachelorarbeit/
> - A compilation by GitHub is triggered every time a release is published. The resulting PDF is added to the release as asset.
> - After each week, a release of the latest version of the main branch is created.
